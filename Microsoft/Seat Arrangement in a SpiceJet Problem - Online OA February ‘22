// Let us suppose n>1
// Now let us suppose first person goes and sits on k position. Now we surely know that person(2 to k-1) will sit on their correct position(Because when person 2 to k-1 comes then they will find their place empty and will sit on their respective seats). Now k'th person has 3 choices

// Sit on seat 1 in which case last person will surely sit on his seat.
// Sit on last seat in which case last person will surely not sit on his seat.
// Sit on some seat from k+1 to n-1.
// Now if he takes option 3 then he will sit on some seat say "j". Now j will again have three options to sit.
// This cycle will continue and every person can sit on first and last seat will equal probability. Hence the probability will be 0.5
